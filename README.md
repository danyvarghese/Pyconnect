# Pyconnect - Bridging MIL/ILP Approaches with Robotic Simulations

## Overview

**Pyconnect** is an integral solution crafted to bridge the gap between **MIL/ILP approaches**, typically grounded in the **Prolog** programming language, and r**obotics simulations**, predominantly designed using **Python**. Pyconnect is the key that makes it possible for the abstract intelligence from MIL/ILP to work with the practical simulation features of modern robotic systems.



## Why Pyconnect?

Pyconnect emerges as a solution to these challenges. It offers:

1. A unified interface to synergize Prolog-based logic planning with Python-driven robotic simulations
2. Smooth interoperability, reducing the complexity of integration
3. A platform to harness the power of intuitive machine learning in real-world robotic scenarios

## Getting Started
To begin exploring this integrated solution:

1. Familiarize yourself with the surrey_bath [surrey_bath](https://github.com/stassa/surrey_bath) repository to understand the workings of the autonomous agent.
2. Dive into the [survey-simulation](https://github.com/aoat20/survey-simulation) repository for insights into the robotics simulator.
3. Follow the integration instructions (to be provided or linked) to set up the combined environment
