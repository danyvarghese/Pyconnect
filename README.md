# Pyconnect - Bridging MIL/ILP Approaches with Robotic Simulations

## Overview
**Pyconnect** is an integral solution crafted to bridge the gap between **MIL/ILP approaches**, typically grounded in the **Prolog** programming language, and r**obotics simulations**, predominantly designed using **Python**. Pyconnect is the key that makes it possible for the abstract intelligence from MIL/ILP to work with the practical simulation features of modern robotic systems.

## Why Pyconnect?

Pyconnect emerges as a solution to these challenges. It offers:

1. A unified interface to synergize Prolog-based logic planning with Python-driven robotic simulations.
2. Smooth interoperability, reducing the complexity of integration.
3. A platform to harness the power of intuitive machine learning in real-world robotic scenarios.
